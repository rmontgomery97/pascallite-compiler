# pascallite-compiler
This program compiles a simple version of pascal into an assembly language made for a simulated computer built as a teaching tool. The code is pretty messy and what I would call "homework" code. It was made for a class my senior year of undergrad.

### Usage

To run the program, compile it and then use this format from the command line
```
./stage2 dataFile listingFile objFile
```
